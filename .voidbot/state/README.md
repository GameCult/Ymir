# Ymir Persona State

`ymir.cc` is Ymir's repo-local persistent Persona state.

Do not hand-edit the `.cc` file. Use the repo-local tools:

```powershell
.\tools\persona-state-read.ps1
.\tools\persona-remember.ps1 -Summary "..." -Claim "..." -Tension "..." -ActionImplication "..."
```

The tools call VoidBot's typed self-state service so the same document schema
used by registered repo Faces owns mutation and reads.

VoidBot automatic indexing requires Ymir to be registered as a repo Face
identity in VoidBot. Until then, this file is local typed state and can still be
read or mutated by the tools here.
